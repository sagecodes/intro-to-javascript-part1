## What is programming?
Simply put: Programming is giving your computer a set of instructions to perform a task. 

This sounds simple but it can get complicated! [Peanut Butter & Jelly Sandwich example](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XWe4iohhmIw)

## What is javaScript?

A [interpreted](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interpreter_(computing)) programming language .

Its NOT the programming language Java

> The similarity of `Java` and `JavaScript` is comparable to `grapes` and `grapefruit`...

### A very brief history

Created by Brendan Eich in 1995 in ONLY 10 days during his time at Netscape Communications.

A lot of updates have happened of course since then, but its still fun to see some of the [quirks](https://www.destroyallsoftware.com/talks/wat) still in the language!

Read more about the history of JavaScript [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JavaScript).

Its one of the major building block of the web! 

Javascript is often used with HTML and CSS to create dynamic web pages. 

### Who uses javaScript?

Almost everyone!

- Large Companies (Google, Facebook)
- Startups
- Agencies
- Pretty much anyone using web technology

It's one of the safest languages to learn for getting a job as a developer.


### What can you do with JavaScript

# JavaScript Basics: Lets code!

## Comments
You'll see comments throughout code. In Javascript they are made with `//`. They are a great way of explaining what your code is doing. So when you come back to it months later it won't be as confusing. Or when a new team member works on your code base

```
// I am a comment. I do not change any output
```

```
/*
I am 
a
multi
line 
comment
*/
```

## Print output

In programming its tradition to start with printing the output of "Hello, World!". You do this in JavaScript with the `console.log()` function!

print Hello, World!

`console.log("Hello, World!");`

## Variables:
Variable are a way to store information.
This is super useful! You can then receive or update the variable in your program. You'll see this later!

Think of it as naming a piece of data.

We're going to define our variable using the keyword `var`. 

```
var twitter = "@sagecodes";
var score = 0;

console.log(twitter);

```

**Note:** Semi semicolons. Think of them as statement separators. When in doubt use them. Especially if you're just starting out! 

You can read a little bit more about why [here](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/444080/do-you-recommend-using-semicolons-after-every-statement-in-javascript).

Can be important to keep in mind when using something to [minify](https://javascript-minifier.com/) your code. 

Another good [read](https://mariusschulz.com/blog/semicolons-after-function-declarations-in-javascript).


### Declaring Variables

In newer versions of JavaScript you will see is `let` or `const` used instead of `var`.

- `Const` is used to declare variables you do not want to change later in your code. 

- `let` is similar to `var`, but has a newer featured called block scoping(We'll talk more about scopes in part 2) and perhaps more importantly prevents name collision (We'll take a look at this below).

### Examples:

using `var`

```
var globalvar = 'hello';

// CAN declare new variable with existing name (it overwrites)
var globalvar = 'by';

// CAN assign new value to variable
globalvar = 'new value';

```

using `let`

```
let globalvar = 'hello';

// CANNOT declare new variable with existing name
let globalvar = 'by';

// CAN assign new value to variable
globalvar = 'by';
``` 

using `const`

```
const globalvar = 'hello';

// CANNOT declare new variable with existing name
const globalvar = 'by';

// CANNOT assign new value to variable
globalvar = 'by';
``` 

Essentially `let` and `const` are considered "safer" to use.


You may see all variations for the rest of the workshop. Its OK to use what ever you want starting out, but industry is prefers the safer versions.


### Challenge: Get a users name

Create a variable called name and assign it your name. Use the `console.log` function to print out the variable value.


## Interact with dialog boxes
Using dialog boxes can be simple way to get started interacting with users.

**Note**: These don't work in repl anymore, but we can use them in our own files or in our developer console. I'll show you how to do this!

Alert: Pop up information in a dialog box

`alert("Hello, I'm a pop up");`
 
Prompt: get information from a user in dialog box

`prompt("I'm a pop up you can type in!");`

### Challenge: Get a users name

Use the `prompt()` function above to ask a user for a name, save it in a variable called `name` and print the variable using `console.log()`

You WILL have to use your developer console for this one!


## Data Types:
We're going to stick with the basics, so We wont be going over EVERY data type in javascript and not every detail, but you you can read a more comprehensive list [here](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Data_structures).  

Feel free to try these code samples out in your [repl](https://repl.it/)!

### Numbers:

Numbers are written just like you would think. Just the number! No quotes or symbols to worry about. If you do put quotes around a number it will become a string (see next)

`25` `100`

Multiple, Add, Divide, Compare

- `5 * 5` | output: 25
- `5 + 5` | output: 10
- `8 / 2` | output: 4
- `8 > 2` | output: true
- `8 % 8` | output: 0

### Strings:
Strings can be a collection of letters, symbols and/or numbers. They are made by surrounding the content with quotation marks.

`"Hello, World."`

`"CrAzy Random String 987879896jvdjvda &&(&(@*(*"`

They can use double quotes or single quotes. Make sure they are matching and the string does not contain any breaking quotes inside it!

If you need to include a single quote in a single quote string we can use the escape character `\` backslash in our string. `console.log('Sage\'s string')`


Can we add strings together? Try it out!




#### Print strings with variable in them:

Concatenation

```
var name = "Alexa";
var age = 40;
var career = "programmer";

var s = "My name is " + name + ". I am " + age + " years old. I am a " + career + "." ;

console.log(s);

```

A newer ES6 way! 

You may want to use the the newer back-tick ` way creating a string. Called a template literal. 

This is much cleaner and easier to edit later in my opinion

**note** The string containing the variable using back-ticks |  ` | not single quotes. 

```
var name = "Alexa"
var age = 40
var career = "programmer"

var s = `My name is ${name}. I am ${age} years old. I am a ${career}. `;

console.log(s);

```

### Challenge

Make 3 variables and use them in your own string. Print out the string with `console.log`


### Booleans:
You can think of Booleans as yes(true) and no(false)

`true` `false`

We'll go into how to use these in a little bit. For now just remember they exist!

### Arrays (lists):

Often used to store a list of values.

Arrays use `[]` square brackets

#### Create array

```
var tvshows = ['West World','Mr. Robot', 'Game of Thrones'];
console.log(tvshows);
```

#### Access Items in Array

```
var tvshows = ['West World','Mr. Robot', 'Game of Thrones'];

// print the first item in array;
console.log(tvshows[0]);
```

#### Update Items in Array

```
var tvshows = ['West World','Mr. Robot', 'Game of Thrones']

console.log(tvshows[0]);

// Assign new value to first item of array
tvshows[0] = "Robots in the west";

// print the first item in array
console.log(tvshows[0]);
```

#### Adding Items in Array

```
var tvshows = ['West World','Mr. Robot', 'Game of Thrones']

console.log(tvshows);

// add new value to first item of array
tvshows.push("Firefly");

// print the first item in array
console.log(tvshows);
```

#### Removing Items from Array


```

var tvshows = ['West World','Mr. Robot', 'Game of Thrones', "Firefly"]

console.log(tvshows);

// remove last item with pop
tvshows.pop();
console.log(tvshows);

delete tvshows[1];
console.log(tvshows);

```

#### Splice 

 add specific indexes with splice

```
var tvshows = ['West World','Mr. Robot', 'Game of Thrones', "Firefly"]

console.log(tvshows);

// index, how many to remove, optional items to add
tvshows.splice(2, 0, "Breaking Bad", "Watchmen");

console.log(tvshows);

```

remove specific indexes with splice

```
var tvshows = ['West World','Mr. Robot', 'Game of Thrones', "Firefly"]

console.log(tvshows);

// index, how many to remove, optional items to add
tvshows.splice(2, 1,);

console.log(tvshows);

```

### Objects (Dictionaries):

#### Create Object

`person =	{ "name": "Bob", "age": 50, "occupation": 'programmer' }`

```
var person =	{
  "name": "Alexa",
  "age": 40,
  "occupation": 'programmer'
};

```

#### Access Items in an Object


```
var person =	{
  "name": "Alexa",
  "age": 40,
  "occupation": 'programmer'
};


console.log(person);

// two ways of accessing items
console.log(person.name);
console.log(person['age']);

// example using object inside a string senence. 
var s = `My name is ${person.name}. I am ${person["age"]} years old. I am a ${person.occupation}. `;

console.log(s);

```

#### Update Items in Object


```
var person =	{
  "name": "Alexa",
  "age": 40,
  "occupation": 'programmer'
};


console.log(person);

// Select element and assign new variable
person.name = "Bob";

console.log(person);

```

#### Adding Items in Object

```
var person =	{
  "name": "Alexa",
  "age": 40,
  "occupation": 'programmer'
};


console.log(person);

// or person['newkey']
person.newkey = "Im a new item";

console.log(person);

```

#### Removing Items from Object

```

var person =	{
  "name": "Alexa",
  "age": 40,
  "occupation": 'programmer',
  "newkey": "Im a new item"
};


console.log(person);

// use delete
delete person.newkey

console.log(person);

```


### Access Object value in Array 

```
var person =	{
  "name": "Alexa",
  "age": 40,
  "occupation": 'programmer',
  "newkey": "Im a new item"
};

// Add object to list
var listy = [3, "hello", person]

console.log(listy)

// Access a object item from object in array
console.log(listy[2].name)

// Access a object item from object in array
console.log(listy[2]["age"])

```

### Access Array item in Object

```
var favfoods = ["apples", "mac & cheese", "chcolate"]

var person =	{
  "name": "Alexa",
  "age": 40,
  "occupation": 'programmer',
  "favs": favfoods
};


// Access a object item from object in array
console.log(person.favs[0])

// Access a object item from object in array
console.log(person.favs[1])

```




## Comparison Operators:
Comparison Operators are used quite frequently in programming. Its a great way to compare and use data.

Again we won't cover ALL of the comparison operators in this workshop, but you can see a full list of them [here](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Guide/Expressions_and_Operators)

- `==` Equal
- `===` Strict Equal
- `!=` Not Equal
- `>` Greater Than
- `>=` Greater Than or Equal
- `<` Less Than
- `<=` Less Than or Equal

Example use:

`current_score >= highest_score`
This would return a boolean value. Depending on the values of these variables this would return either `true` or `false`. Try it in your console using numbers instead of variables!

`===` Strict Equal vs `==` Equal?



## Conditionals

When writing a program you'll often want to check if data meets a certain condition or not. We can use conditionals to make decision about our data and create different outcomes

 In javascript you'll often use the `if` statement. This may be followed by `else if` or `else` depending on how many conditions need to be checked.

Example:

```
var guess = 5;
var answer = 4;

if (guess == answer) {
    message = "You Win!";
} else if (guess < answer) {
    message = "Your guess is too low!";
} else if (guess > answer){
    message = "your guess is too high!";
} else {
	message = "I think you entered something wrong...";
};

```

Using multiple conditions:


Check if both variables meet condition

`if (variable1 == 0 && variable2 == 0)`


Check if either variable meets condition

`if (variable1 == 0 || variable2 == 0)`

### Challenge: Dynamic output

Use conditionals to compare two variable and change its output depending on the variables. 


## Loops
We're going to go over some of the basic loops in javascript, but yet again we're not going to cover everything, so you may want to read more about loops [here](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Guide/Loops_and_iteration).

Loops are used when you want to repeat something. You can repeat the exact same thing, or change some variable and repeat the action again.

two common types of loops are `for` and `while`.
`for` loops are often used to run a loop a specified amount of time.

`while` loops are often used to run a loop indefinitely until certain criteria are met.

Example:

This `for` loop will run 5 times, and print out the value of `i` to the console. 

```
var i;
for (i = 1; i <= 5; i++) {
    console.log(i)
}
```

```
for (var i=1; i <= 5; i++) {
    console.log(i);
}

```

Example:

This `while` loop will run until is no longer less than 8 

```
var i = 0;
while (i < 8) {
    console.log("I will crash your browser if you don't increment i")
    i++
}

```

If `i` were set to 1 it would run this loop and print the string until the value of `i` changed. If you run this in your browser it will probably crash it!

```
var i = 0;
while (i == 1) {
    console.log("I will crash your browser")
}
```

### Challenge: FizzBuzz

[Fizzbuzz](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fizz_buzz) and variations of it is a popular interview question. 

"From 1 to 100.

For each multiple of 3, print "Fizz" instead of the number. 

For each multiple of 5, print "Buzz" instead of the number. 

For numbers which are multiples of both 3 and 5, print "FizzBuzz" instead of the number."

Lets break it down and solve it together!
